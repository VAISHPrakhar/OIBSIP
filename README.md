Task 1 : In this task I've created a BMI calculator which takes in the user input based on their weight and height. 
It uses the basic mathematical formula for calculating the BMI i.e.         Weight in kg/ (Height in meter)**2

Task 2 : In this task I have created a Random password generator which gives the user an option wether they want a digit, letter and symbols in 
their password. This works similar to the random google password generator just on a smaller scale.

Task 3 : In this task i will be creating a program which tells us what the weather is in the selected area. It is not a live interactive 
weather application/program but works for few regions for which the preset is defined.
In this code I've used beautifulsoup library. It is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages.
